# HumanDonor

A human donor of any biosample, including cell lines. Submission of any sample originating from a human donor requires submission of information about the relevant donor. For example, submission of the donor of K562 is a prerequisite for submission of any K562 cell line samples. The following fields are **required**: `award`, `lab`, `rrid`, `living_donor`, `bmi`, `diabetes_status`, `diabetes_status_description`, and `taxa`. These fields must be included for the schema to be valid. Additionally, the following fields are **desired**: `center_donor_id`, `ethnicities`, `hba1c`, `diabetes_status_hba1c`, `glucose_loweing_theraphy`, `hospital_stay`, `donation_type`, and `cause_of_death`. While these fields are not mandatory, their inclusion is highly recommended for a more comprehensive data submission.

## Example

```python
from igvf_client.models.human_donor import HumanDonor

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of HumanDonor from a JSON string
human_donor_instance = HumanDonor.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(HumanDonor.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
human_donor_dict = human_donor_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of HumanDonor from a dict
human_donor_from_dict = HumanDonor.from_dict(human_donor_dict)
